                    It may seem that it is impossible to protect our data against big tech companies however, recent
                    events have indicated otherwise. For instance, recently employees at Amazon are calling an end to
                    the sale of the companyâ€™s facial recognition technology and partnerships with the U.S immigration
                    and Customs Enforcement due to how such technology contribute to oppressive paradigms. Furthermore,
                    big tech has been under great scrutiny by the government and public alike over their use and
                    collection of data. This has lead to ongoing investigations and regulations that protect users right
                    to privacy. Such events are in the right step in the right direction. By informing local communities
                    the risk of data collection by big tech and advocating for more transparency, only then can the
                    risks from data use and collection be mitigated.
