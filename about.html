                    Although technology has brought us many advancements, even going as far as having the perception of
                    being a “social equalizer”, there are still a lot of consequences it can bring.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The purpose of this website outlines the stages of how large tech companies (such as MAANG) exploit
                    their user base and contribute to systematic oppression based on the data they have collected from
                    their user. By having a deeper understanding of the data collection process big tech companies
                    conduct, it can lead to increase awareness of the risk of being too exposed online and explore
                    solutions on how to make tech more transparent.
