                    Data collection begins during the initial stage of presenting terms and conditions to a user. This
                    stage typically consists of an agreement form that the user consents to, enabling them to use a
                    company's digital product. In most cases, these forms present only the option to agree or disagree
                    to the terms. The full texts of the terms tend to be designed to be hard for the average consumer
                    to find and comprehend. As each company has a monopoly over their specific product, companies force
                    consumers into consenting to data collection leading users to be unable to control their own
                    information.

                    There are three different ways companies can collect data on their users. The first method is
                    user-provided data, which involves filtering and gathering any information that the consumer has
                    shared. This includes information such as names, email addresses, and profile information the user
                    has filled out. For some companies, user-generated data also includes anything the consumer has done
                    with a digital product whether the information is published or not. Some examples are drafts,
                    comments, and direct messages.
                    <br><br>
                    The second method is automatically collected data, which encompasses the technical information of a
                    user such as device type, IP address, and location. In most cases, third-party information gathered
                    through this method is to improve the functionality of a product.
                    <br><br>
                    The final method is through third-party providers, where tech companies collect information on
                    users through other services, analytical tools, and advertisers. This method also includes any third
                    party provider that a tech company has partnered with, that is not necessarily disclosed to the user.
                    An example of this method would be if someone creates a Facebook account using a Google login.
                    By using a Google login, Facebook and Google will share information with each other that includes
                    the user's contact information and behavior on each platform.

                    As there are different types of data that can be collected from a user, consequently there are many
                    applications for the data collected. One important application is analyzing user
                    data for product development. In this case, using feedback provided from users and interpreting
                    collected behavioral data can enable improved functionality of a product. Another application is
                    that it allows users to create their own personalized experience. By collecting the preferences of
                    a user, data can be used to create interactions within a product that align more with a users
                    interests and needs. The examples mentioned above are just to name a few and there are plenty of
                    other applications of user data collection.

<!--Risks/Consequences-->

                    Despite the benefits that the applications of data collection can bring, there are numerous risks
                    that can still arise. These issues include compromising user privacy, contributing to
                    discrimination, and sharing more information than users intended. One example can be demonstrated
                    through the company Ring, a security system company owned by Amazon. Recently the company has been
                    trying to incorporate facial recognition to their surveillance products where the product will be
                    able to flag someone who happens to come across the camera feed as suspicious based on some
                    cross-referenced list of “suspects”. Such a product can be problematic as facial recognition
                    technologies are heavily susceptible to racial biases and can amplify racial prejudice especially
                    in the context of security. Furthermore, law enforcement will have the ability to access the
                    systems private networks with or without the owners consent. Overall, it is important to take in
                    consideration of how data use and collection can be harmful.
