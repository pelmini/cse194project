                    Data collection begins during the initial stage of presenting terms and condition to a user. This
                    stage typically consists of an agreement form that the user consents to, enabling them to use a
                    company's digital product. In most cases, these forms present only the option to agree or disagree
                    to the terms. The full texts of the terms tend to be designed to be hard for the average consumer
                    to find and comprehend. As each company has a monopoly over their specific product, companies force
                    consumers into consenting to data collection leading users to be unable to control their own
                    information.

                    There are three different ways companies can collect data on their users. The first method is
                    user-provided data, which involves filtering and gathering any information that the consumer has
                    shared. This includes information such as names, email addresses, and profile information the user
                    has filled out. For some companies, user-generated data also includes anything the consumer has done
                    with a digital product whether the information is published or not. Some examples are drafts,
                    comments, and direct messages.
                    <br><br>
                    The second method is automatically collected data, which encompasses the technical information of a
                    user such as device type, IP address, and location. In most cases, third-party information gathered
                    through this method is to improve the functionality of a product.
                    <br><br>
                    The final method is through third-party providers, where tech companies collect information on
                    users through other services, analytical tools, and advertisers. This method also includes any third
                    party provider that a tech company has partnered with, that is not necessarily disclosed to the user.
                    An example of this method would be if someone creates a Facebook account using a Google login.
                    By using a Google login, Facebook and Google will share information with each other that includes
                    the user's contact information and behavior on each platform.
